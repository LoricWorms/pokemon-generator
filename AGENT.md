# Agent Onboarding

This repository is now a basic React application demonstrating client-side data persistence with IndexedDB.

## How to self-orient
- Read `docs/introduction.md` to get the high-level overview of the platform.
- **Consult `project-manager/general-objectives.md` for the overarching goals of the project.**
- **Refer to `project-manager/styling-guide.md` for UI/UX principles and design consistency.**
- When adding or updating UI features, cross-check that every interaction traces back to the documented behavior.

## Working guidelines
- Treat the Markdown docs as the source of truth—ask the user only when documentation is unclear or incomplete.
- Surface undocumented gaps or inconsistencies you discover while implementing features.
- Align component naming, user-facing labels, and validation messages with terminology used in the docs.
- Add follow-up documentation updates whenever UI changes require documentation adjustments.
- **Maintain `project-manager/tasks.md` diligently:**
    - On every run, read and update the `tasks.md` file.
    - Add new tasks as checkboxes under the "Planned" section.
    - Move tasks from "Planned" to "On Progress" when you start working on them.
    - Move tasks from "On Progress" to "Done" when they are completed.
    - Ensure completed tasks are checked `[x]`.
    - Provide concise, descriptive task names.
