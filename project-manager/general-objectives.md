# General Project Objectives: Pokémon Generation Application

This application aims to provide an interactive and engaging experience for generating and collecting unique Pokémon using a text-to-image AI model.

## Core Purpose

The primary goal is to demonstrate an AI-powered image generation system within a fun, gamified context, while leveraging client-side persistent storage.

## Key Objectives

1.  **AI-Powered Pokémon Generation:** Allow users to generate unique Pokémon visuals and metadata (name, rarity) by interacting with an external text-to-image AI API.
2.  **Resource Management (Tokens):** Implement a token-based economy where users start with 100 tokens, spend 10 tokens per generation, and earn 5 tokens for selling a Pokémon. This introduces a strategic element.
3.  **Client-Side Persistence:** Ensure all generated Pokémon and user's token balance are stored locally using IndexedDB, allowing for offline access and data persistence across sessions.
4.  **Collection Management:** Provide a user interface for viewing and managing their collection of generated Pokémon.
5.  **Interactive User Experience:** Offer a fluid and visually appealing interface for generating, collecting, and selling Pokémon.
6.  **Educational Demonstration:** Serve as a practical example of integrating AI APIs with modern frontend frameworks and client-side data storage solutions.

## Guiding Principles

*   **User Engagement:** The application should be fun and encourage repeated interaction.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure reliable storage and retrieval of user data (Pokémon and tokens).
*   **Clarity:** User interface and interactions should be intuitive and easy to understand.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for a smooth user experience, especially during image generation and collection display.
*   **Responsiveness:** The application should work well across various device sizes.
